# smallcase-assignment

This assignment was done using:

1. React
2. CSS3
3. react-router-dom
4. firebase (to mimic an API)

## The site is hosted on : [Link](https://smallcase-assignment.firebaseapp.com)

The app was generated using ```create-react-app``` and hence I've used ```yarn``` to build the source and also to install all the dependencies which can be seen in the ```package.json``` file.

To see the output, just ```clone``` this repository and follow the steps given below:

### To install all the dependencies

```text
yarn install
```

OR

```text
npm install
```

### To run

```text
yarn start
```

OR

```text
npm run start
```

Et Voila! The file explorer web UI in your preferred browser on served on ```localhost:3000```.
